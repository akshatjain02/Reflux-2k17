        <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">An integral part of any learning process is its actual application in real life. In Chemical Engineering and many other disciplines, we come across various tools and algorithms we require to help us find answer to our solution in an easy way. This is our effort in this direction to enlighten you with the various helpful practices by giving you a hands-on experience and do-it-yourself solutions.
