		An integral part of any learning process is its actual application in real life.
		In chemical engineering, we come across various tools and algorithms we require to help us find answer to our solution in an easy way.
		This is our effort in this direction to enlighten you with the various helpful practices by giving you a hands-on experience and do-it-yourself situations.

		Atomistic simulations have emerged in recent years as an important compliment to experiment for understanding the structural, thermodynamic and transport properties of chemical systems. One of the major technique is Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. In this workshop using MD techniques will be discussed by using Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD) package and Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) packages.

		<p>
		ASPEN Plus is a process simulation software package widely used in industry today. Given a process design and an appropriate selection of thermodynamic models, ASPEN uses mathematical models to predict the performance of the process. This information can then be used in an iterative fashion to optimize the design.ASPEN can handle very complex processes, including multiple-column separation systems, chemical reactors, distillation of chemically reactive compounds and even electrolyte solutions like mineral acids and sodium hydroxide solutions.

		<p>
		CADWorx P&ID is a software for creating P&IDs (Process and Instrumentation Diagram) and associated documentation such as loop diagrams, datasheets, schedules and reports. It allows for the quick and easy creation of fully intelligent P&ID's and does so without the need to change the current look and feel of existing drawings, symbols or corporate standards. CADWorx P&ID optionally allows P&ID components to be placed using piping specifications, thereby improving accuracy and enabling component checks against the plant model.
